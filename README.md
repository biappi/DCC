This is a fork of the DCC decompiler by Cristina Cifuentes, Mike van
Emmerik, and Jeff Ledermann, to be run on "modern" machines.

The original source code has been reworked to use the
[meson build engine](https://mesonbuild.com) and reformatted using
[ClangFormat](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html).
